# ORIE 4741 - How is Urbanization Affecting the Environment? - Project Proposal

**Background:**
As the world becomes more globalized, itâ€™s easier for more people to move to other cities and countries. The migration of people from rural to urban areas is changing the way that cities are structured. The way that people move also has a significant impact on social structures, urban planning, public health, and the environment, among many others.

**The Question:** 
Is changing urbanization correlated to climate change and if so, how does it affect it? What countries/regions are more people emigrating to and how do the population levels there affect greenhouse gas emissions? Can we predict future greenhouse gas emissions (ie: CO2 levels) in different countries/regions; what regions could benefit the most from investing in renewable power infrastructure?

**The Issue:** 
Global warming may lead to extremely detrimental effects to the environment by 2050, [including flooded cities and forced migration](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/30/environment-2050-flooded-cities-forced-migration-amazon-turning-savannah). 
According to Time magazine, [within five to ten years, major segments of the U.S. will be uninhabitable by humans](https://time.com/5824295/climate-change-future-possibilities/) due to increases in greenhouse gas emissions.

**The Significance:**
 In this project, we aim to understand how urbanization and the ways that cities have adapted to greater urban populations impacts the environment. If we can identify which countries which will most benefit from renewable energies based on urbanization patterns, then we will gain insights into how to build a more sustainable world. 

**Data:**
The World Development Indicators from the World Bank contain over a thousand annual indicators of economic development from hundreds of countries around the world: https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators

Secondary dataset (if needed): https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization#number-of-people-living-in-urban-areas 

We will begin this analysis by first looking into the ways that urban and rural populations have changed globally, by country, since 1960. Next we will explore the CO2 emission levels within specific countries who have seen high rates of urbanization and see the impact of urbanization on climate change.
