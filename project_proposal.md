# ORIE 4741 - How is Urbanization Affecting the Environment? - Project Proposal

**Background:**
As the world becomes more globalized, itâ€™s easier for more people to move to other cities and countries. The migration of people from rural to urban areas is changing the way that cities are structured and how people use transportation. The way that people move also has a significant impact on social structures, urban planning, public health, and the environment, among many others.

**The Question:** 
Is changing urbanization affecting how we engage with transportation? What forms of urban transportation are becoming more popular (bikes, cars, trains, walking) and how do they affect greenhouse gas emissions? How do greenhouse gas emissions (ie: CO2 levels) impact global warming; what countries could benefit the most from investing in renewable power infrastructure and more eco-friendly modes of transportation?

**The Issue:** 
Global warming may lead to extremely detrimental effects to the environment by 2050, [including flooded cities and forced migration](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/30/environment-2050-flooded-cities-forced-migration-amazon-turning-savannah). 
According to Time magazine, [within five to ten years, major segments of the U.S. will be uninhabitable by humans](https://time.com/5824295/climate-change-future-possibilities/) due to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative modes of transportation offer ways to combat this trend.

**The Significance:**
 In this project, we aim to understand how urbanization and the ways that cities have adapted to greater urban populations, specifically in regards to transportation, impacts the environment. If we can identify which countries which will most benefit from renewable energies based on urbanization patterns and if we can explore the specific types of transportation which are most environmentally efficient, then we will gain insights into how to build a more sustainable world. 

**Data:**

We will begin this analysis by first looking into the ways that urban and rural populations have changed globally, by country, since 1960. Next we will explore the transportation methods within specific countries who have seen high rates of urbanization and see the impact of transportation and urbanization on climate change within specific countries.
