Analysis of Urbanization and Transportation Data: Predicting places that could benefit from renewable energy

Samantha Lee (SRL84), Olia Javidi (OJ33), and Katie Lie (YL2249)

Our goal is to analyze changing urbanization dynamics across the globe and identify cities with high rates of urbanization. From there we will ask:

1) How do different urban transportations affect greenhouse gas emissions? 

2) Which countries could benefit the most from investing in more eco-friendly modes of transportation?
