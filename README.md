Impact of Urbanization n the Environment: Predicting places that could benefit from renewable energy

Samantha Lee (SRL84), Olia Javidi (OJ33), and Katie Li (YL2249)

Our goal is to analyze changing urbanization dynamics across the globe and identify countries with high rates of urbanization. From there we will ask:

1) Which countries are urbanizing at the fastest rate?

2) Which countries are emitting the most greenhouse gas emissions and is it correlated to climate change? 

2) Which countries could benefit the most from investing in renewable power infrastructure?
