Global CO2 Emissions: Prediction and Mitigation

Samantha Lee (SRL84), Olia Javidi (OJ33), and Katie Li (YL2249)

**Goals**

Our goal is to analyze and predict carbon emissions across the globe and identify ways to mitigate per capita CO2 emissions. From there we will ask:

1) Which countries have the highest rates of carbon emissions per capita?

2) Which indicators have the biggest influence on CO2 emissions?

3) What changes can countries make to reduce their carbon emissions?

**Milestones**

"Project_Proposal.md" contains the full project proposal.

"Midterm Report.pdf" contains the midterm milestone.

"Final Report.pdf" contains the final milestone writeup.

**File Descriptions**

"PreProcessing&FeatureSelection.ipynb" contains the code for initial dataset filtering, dealing with NaN values, overfitting/underfitting, and random forest regression for feature selection.

"4741projectpt1.R" separates our data between countries and regions in R.

"4741projectpt2.R" tests out subset selection algorithms.

"4741projectpt3.R" contains crossvalidation for best subset selection.

"4741projectpt4.R" compares different countries in the context of the whole world.

"regions.ipynb" contains a look at CO2 emission trends by country and region across the globe.
