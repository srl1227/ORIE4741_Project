Impact of Urbanization on the Environment: Predicting places that could benefit from renewable energy

Samantha Lee (SRL84), Olia Javidi (OJ33), and Katie Li (YL2249)

Our goal is to analyze changing urbanization dynamics across the globe and identify countries with high rates of urbanization. From there we will ask:

1) Which countries are urbanizing at the fastest rate?

2) Which countries are emitting the most greenhouse gas emissions and is it correlated to climate change? 

2) Which countries could benefit the most from investing in renewable power infrastructure?

"Project_Proposal.md" contains the full project proposal.

"PreProcessing&FeatureSelection.ipynb" contains the code for initial dataset filtering, dealing with NaN values, overfitting/underfitting, and random forest regression for feature selection.

"4741projectpt1.R" separates our data between countries and regions in R.

"4741projectpt2.R" tests out subset selection algorithms.

"4741projectpt3.R" contains crossvalidation for best subset selection.

"4741projectpt4.R" compares different countries in the context of the whole world.

"regions.ipynb" contains a look at CO2 emission trends by country and region across the globe.
